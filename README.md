# MESD MOSFET Electrical Simulation Dataset (MESD)

This paper introduces the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) Electrical Simulation Dataset, MESD, an extensive collection of I-V and C-V characteristics data simulated across different foundries' Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Models (BSIMs). The MESD dataset covers a range of bias voltages, temperatures, and MOSFET physical dimensions across several technology nodes from 3 to 350 nm. MESD is designed to serve as a standardized benchmark for evaluating and comparing MOSFET models, aiding semiconductor researchers and model developers in assessing the accuracy of their simulations against a robust set of controlled data.

## Data File Naming Convention

The dataset is in `MESD` folder. The data is recorded with JSON files. Each JSON file corresponds to a device in a PDK. The files are named as `PDK Name`-`Device Name`. MESD includes data from 11 PDKs and 44 types of devices from 350 nm to 3 nm. The PDKs and devices are renamed to avoid leakage of foundry information.

## Data Structure

Each file includes metadata such as PDK name, device name, simulator, and model. The `Record` section is a list, in which each entry includes the `Vgs` and the corresponding `Ids` and `Cgg` under different dimensions (i.e., `W`, `L`, and `Nfin`), simulation conditions (i.e., `Temp` and `Corner`), and voltage bias (`Vds`).

## Data Simulation Script

The `scripts` folder provides examples for the simulation of MOSFET devices. `netlist.dc.spectre` and `netlist.ac.spectre` show the simulation script for `Ids` and `Cgg` collection using Cadence Spectre. Similarly, `netlist.dc.sp` and `netlist.ac.sp` are simulation scripts using Synopsys HSPICE.
